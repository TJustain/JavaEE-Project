# JavaEE-Project
A java/jakarta EE project that allows CRUD operations on users and sprites(circlular objects) that contains a RESTful api and authorization.  
The user system has three diffrent groups: Admin can accses everything, JSF can accses only the jsf pages, and Rest can only accses the api.
Each requires a login which uses a hashing algorigthm to store the password.

This is a very backend focus project with only auto-generated GUIs.
It can certinly be expanded upon:
-Publishing to the web.
-Adding a user creation page.
-Creating a nice frontend.
-Saving data in a non-local database.

Note: This project was created in Netbeans 12.0 and used the glash fish server to host locally.
